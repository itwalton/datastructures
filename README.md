# Data Structures

A collection of popular data structures used to solve commonly-occurring problems in computer science.

### Dependencies

1. Java (v1.8+)
2. Node (v8+)
3. tsc (v2.1.4+)

### To Run

1. Compile the file

**Example (Java):** `javac binarytree/BinaryTree.java`

**Example (TypeScript):** `tsc binarytree/BinaryTree.ts`

2. Run the file

**Example (Java):** `java binarytree.BinaryTree`

**Example (TypeScript):** `node binarytree/BinaryTree.js`


## Binary Tree

*Description*

A tree structure in which a collection of nodes, starting with a root, store pointers to left/right nodes based on their key values. Best used to efficiently sort/traverse a collection of elements. A balanced binary search tree, for example, is capable of traversal in O(logn) time.

## Linked List

*Description*

A collection of nodes, starting with a firstNode, that store a pointer to the next node. Best used to efficiently store a large collection of elements, with the flexibility to add/remove elements with low overhead.
