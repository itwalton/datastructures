2. Node (v8+)
3. tsc (v2.1.4+)

### Java

1. Run `gradle`

## Binary Tree

A tree structure in which a collection of nodes, starting with a root, store pointers to left/right nodes based on their key values. Best used to efficiently sort/traverse a collection of elements. A balanced binary search tree, for example, is capable of traversal in O(logn) time.
